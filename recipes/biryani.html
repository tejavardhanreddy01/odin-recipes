    <h1>Biryani Recipe</h1>
    <img src="../images/biryani.jpg" alt="Authentic Hyderabadi Biryani" width="420">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Here's a classic recipe for authentic Hyderabadi Biryani, known for its aromatic basmati rice layered with spiced marinated meat and slow-cooked to perfection using the "dum" method. First, marinate chicken (or mutton) in yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, fried onions, fresh mint, coriander, lemon juice, and salt. Let it rest for at least 2–4 hours. Meanwhile, parboil basmati rice with whole spices (bay leaf, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon). In a heavy-bottomed pot, layer the marinated meat, followed by the rice, drizzle with saffron milk, ghee, and more fried onions. Seal the pot with dough and cook on low heat (dum) for 30–45 minutes until aromatic steam escapes and the meat is tender.</p>
    <p>Serve hot with raita, mirchi ka salan, or boiled eggs for a complete Hyderabadi feast. This one-pot dish delivers bold flavors and a royal touch rooted in Nizami cuisine.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <li>500g chicken or mutton (bone-in preferred)</li>
      <li>1 cup thick yogurt</li>
      <li>2 tbsp ginger-garlic paste</li>
      <li>1 tsp red chili powder</li>
      <li>½ tsp turmeric</li>
      <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
      <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
      <li>½ cup fried onions</li>
      <li>2 tbsp chopped mint leaves</li>
      <li>2 tbsp chopped coriander leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the rice</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups basmati rice (soaked 30 minutes)</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf</li>
      <li>2-3 green cardamom pods</li>
      <li>3-4 cloves</li>
      <li>1-inch cinnamon stick</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For layering</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A few strands of saffron soaked in 2 tbsp warm milk</li>
      <li>2 tbsp ghee or butter</li>
      <li>Additional fried onions (optional)</li>
      <li>Dough for sealing lid (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large bowl, combine chicken with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, lemon juice, salt, fried onions, mint, and coriander leaves. Mix well, cover, and marinate for at least 2–4 hours (overnight preferred) in the refrigerator.</li>
      <li>Rinse 2 cups of basmati rice until water runs clear. Soak in water for 30 minutes, then drain.</li>
      <li>Boil water in a large pot. Add whole spices (bay leaf, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon) and salt. Add soaked rice and parboil it (cook about 70%). Drain and keep aside.</li>
      <li>Soak a few strands of saffron in 2 tbsp of warm milk. Set aside for layering.</li>
      <li>In a heavy-bottomed pan (preferably Dutch oven or biryani pot), add the marinated chicken as the bottom layer. Spread parboiled rice evenly over the chicken. Drizzle saffron milk, 1–2 tbsp ghee, and some extra fried onions on top.</li>
      <li>Cover the pot with a tight lid. Optionally, seal edges with dough to trap steam. Place the pot on a low flame, and cook on dum for 30–40 minutes. (You can place the pot on a tawa/griddle to avoid direct heat.)</li>
      <li>Turn off the heat. Let the biryani rest for 10 minutes before opening. Gently mix from the bottom and serve with raita or salan.</li>
    </ol>
