    <h1>Biryani Recipe</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Hyderabadi Biryani is a regal, aromatic rice dish that originated in the kitchens of the Nizams and remains one of the most beloved and iconic dishes of Indian cuisine. This layered masterpiece combines fragrant basmati rice with marinated chicken (or mutton), infused with spices, yogurt, fried onions, mint, and saffron. The magic lies in the “dum” cooking method, where the meat and rice are sealed together in a heavy-bottomed pot and slow-cooked over low heat, allowing the flavors to meld deeply and the steam to tenderize the meat while preserving the fragrance of the rice.</p>
    <p>The preparation begins with marinating the meat in a rich blend of yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili, garam masala, and herbs. Meanwhile, the basmati rice is parboiled with whole spices until 70% cooked. In a large pot, layers of marinated meat and rice are alternated, topped with saffron milk, ghee, and fried onions. The pot is then sealed and cooked on dum, traditionally using hot coals or a tawa for even heat distribution. When opened, the biryani reveals soft, flavorful meat and fluffy, aromatic rice—best served hot with raita or mirchi ka salan.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the marinade</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>500g chicken or mutton (bone-in preferred)</li>
      <li>1 cup thick yogurt</li>
      <li>2 tbsp ginger-garlic paste</li>
      <li>1 tsp red chili powder</li>
      <li>½ tsp turmeric</li>
      <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
      <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
      <li>½ cup fried onions</li>
      <li>2 tbsp chopped mint leaves</li>
      <li>2 tbsp chopped coriander leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For the rice</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups basmati rice (soaked 30 minutes)</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf</li>
      <li>2-3 green cardamom pods</li>
      <li>3-4 cloves</li>
      <li>1-inch cinnamon stick</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>For layering</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A few strands of saffron soaked in 2 tbsp warm milk</li>
      <li>2 tbsp ghee or butter</li>
      <li>Additional fried onions (optional)</li>
      <li>Dough for sealing lid (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large bowl, combine chicken with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, red chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, lemon juice, salt, fried onions, mint, and coriander leaves. Mix well, cover, and marinate for at least 2–4 hours (overnight preferred) in the refrigerator.</li>
      <li>Rinse 2 cups of basmati rice until water runs clear. Soak in water for 30 minutes, then drain.</li>
      <li>Boil water in a large pot. Add whole spices (bay leaf, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon) and salt. Add soaked rice and parboil it (cook about 70%). Drain and keep aside.</li>
      <li>Soak a few strands of saffron in 2 tbsp of warm milk. Set aside for layering.</li>
      <li>In a heavy-bottomed pan (preferably Dutch oven or biryani pot), add the marinated chicken as the bottom layer. Spread parboiled rice evenly over the chicken. Drizzle saffron milk, 1–2 tbsp ghee, and some extra fried onions on top.</li>
      <li>Cover the pot with a tight lid. Optionally, seal edges with dough to trap steam. Place the pot on a low flame, and cook on dum for 30–40 minutes. (You can place the pot on a tawa/griddle to avoid direct heat.)</li>
      <li>Turn off the heat. Let the biryani rest for 10 minutes before opening. Gently mix from the bottom and serve with raita or salan.</li>
    </ol>
