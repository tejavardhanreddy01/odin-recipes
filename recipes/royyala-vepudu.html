  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Royyala Vepudu (Spicy Andhra-style Prawn Fry) is a popular coastal Andhra dish that’s loved for its fiery, tangy flavors and crispy texture. Fresh prawns are marinated with a blend of spices including chili powder, turmeric, and garam masala, then sautéed with onions, green chilies, and curry leaves until perfectly cooked and slightly crisp on the edges. This dry, flavorful prawn fry pairs excellently with steamed rice and rasam or as a spicy side with chapati.</p>
  <p>The key to a great Royyala Vepudu lies in using fresh prawns and cooking them quickly over medium-high heat to retain their juiciness while developing a spicy crust. Aromatic ingredients like ginger-garlic paste and mustard seeds add depth, while curry leaves and lemon juice brighten the dish with a distinct South Indian flair.</p>
